    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1. ▢3 lbs green leafy vegetable (1.35kg, like shepherd’s purse, baby bok
        choy, napa cabbage, or Chinese chives)
      </li>
      <li>
        ½ pounds ground pork (680g; can substitute ground chicken or beef, as
        long as they aren’t too lean)
      </li>
      <li>2/3 cup shaoxing wine</li>
      <li>½ cup oil</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon white pepper</li>
      <li>2/3 cup water (plus more for assembly)</li>
      <li>3 packages dumpling wrappers</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Wash your vegetables thoroughly and blanch them in a pot of boiling
        water. Transfer them to an ice bath to cool. Ring out all the water from
        the vegetables and chop very finely.

        To wrap the dumplings, dampen the edges of each circle with some water.
        Put a little less than a tablespoon of filling in the middle. Fold the
        circle in half and pinch the wrapper together at the top. Then make two
        folds on each side, until the dumpling looks like a fan. Make sure it’s
        completely sealed. Repeat until all the filling is gone, placing the
        dumplings on a baking sheet lined with parchment. Make sure the
        dumplings aren’t sticking together.
      </li>
      <li>
        To cook the dumplings, boil them or pan-fry them. To boil, simple bring
        a large pot of water to a boil, drop the dumplings in, and cook until
        they float to the top and the skins are cooked through, but still
        slightly al dente.
      </li>
      <li>
        To pan-fry, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a non-stick pan over medium high
        heat. Place the dumplings in the pan and allow to fry for 2 minutes.
        Pour a thin layer of water into the pan, cover, and reduce heat to
        medium-low. Allow dumplings to steam until the water has evaporated.
        Remove the cover, increase heat to medium-high and allow to fry for a
        few more minutes, until the bottoms of the dumplings are golden brown
        and crisp.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve with soy sauce, Chinese black vinegar, chili sauce, or other
        dipping sauce of your choice!
