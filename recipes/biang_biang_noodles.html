        To wrap the dumplings, dampen the edges of each circle with some water.
        Put a little less than a tablespoon of filling in the middle. Fold the
        circle in half and pinch the wrapper together at the top. Then make two
        folds on each side, until the dumpling looks like a fan. Make sure it’s
        completely sealed. Repeat until all the filling is gone, placing the
        dumplings on a baking sheet lined with parchment. Make sure the
        dumplings aren’t sticking together.

        To cook the dumplings, boil them or pan-fry them. To boil, simple bring
        a large pot of water to a boil, drop the dumplings in, and cook until
        they float to the top and the skins are cooked through, but still
        slightly al dente.
      </li>
      <li>
        To pan-fry, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a non-stick pan over medium high
        heat. Place the dumplings in the pan and allow to fry for 2 minutes.
        Pour a thin layer of water into the pan, cover, and reduce heat to
        medium-low. Allow dumplings to steam until the water has evaporated.
        Remove the cover, increase heat to medium-high and allow to fry for a
        few more minutes, until the bottoms of the dumplings are golden brown
        and crisp.
      </li>

        Serve with soy sauce, Chinese black vinegar, chili sauce, or other
        dipping sauce of your choice!
